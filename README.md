# Weather-Data-Retrieval-and-Visualization-Using-Mathematica
Retrieves and visualizes real-world weather data using Mathematica’s WeatherData function. Demonstrates basic data analysis, visualization, and exploration of meteorological trends.

--------------------------
# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Mathematica for real-world data analysis by retrieving and visualizing weather data from global weather stations. It was designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of programmatic data access, basic analysis, and data-driven storytelling using Mathematica’s built-in WeatherData command.

# Key Aspects
-> Learn how to use the WeatherData function to retrieve historical and current weather measurements.

-> Explore various weather properties (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) using different input combinations.

-> Visualize weather trends using built-in Mathematica plotting functions for easier interpretation and insight.

-> Understand limitations and capabilities of structured data inputs and outputs in scientific computing.

# Skills I Applied
-> Data retrieval and querying from built-in data sources

-> Data visualization (line plots, bar charts, etc.)

-> Parameter tuning and input optimization

-> Interpretation of meteorological data in standard units

-> Technical communication and tutorial writing
